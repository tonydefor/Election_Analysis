## Create an Election Analysis Using Pypoll

### For my project, i'll be assisting a Colorado board of elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. I am tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
